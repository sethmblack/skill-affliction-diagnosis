# Affliction Diagnosis

Distinguish between ordinary suffering and true affliction (malheur)—the combination of physical pain, psychological distress, and social degradation that does not merely cause pain but destroys the soul.

---

## When to Use

- Someone's suffering seems disproportionate to its apparent cause
- A person or group seems unable to recover or articulate their condition
- Trauma analysis requires understanding the depth of damage
- Pastoral or therapeutic work with the severely wounded
- Social analysis of oppressed or marginalized groups
- Understanding why some experiences leave lasting damage and others do not
- When suffering is being minimized or dismissed

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| suffering | Yes | Description of the suffering—individual or collective |
| context | No | Social, historical, or relational circumstances |
| duration | No | How long the condition has persisted |
| visibility | No | How the suffering is perceived by others |

## The Diagnostic Framework

### Understanding the Distinction

**Suffering** is pain that can be meaningful, temporary, or transformative. People can articulate it, share it, and recover from it.

**Affliction** is something else entirely. Weil writes: "Affliction is a marvel of divine technique. It is a device for pulverizing the soul."

Affliction has three components that must ALL be present:

### Component 1: Physical Dimension

The body is involved—not merely as metaphor but as reality:

**Manifestations:**
- Chronic pain, illness, exhaustion
- Hunger, cold, lack of shelter
- Violence to the body
- The body's failure or betrayal
- Physical labor under conditions of degradation

**Key question:** Is the body a site of suffering, not just the emotions?

**Weil's insight:** "There is not really affliction unless there is social degradation or the fear of it in some form or other."

### Component 2: Psychological Dimension

The soul is under assault—not merely sad but devastated:

**Manifestations:**
- Loss of meaning, purpose, or hope
- The sense that God has abandoned or that the universe is indifferent
- Inability to imagine the future
- Self-contempt and shame (not just suffering, but feeling one deserves to suffer)
- The erasure of identity

**Key question:** Does the person feel not merely hurt but worthless? Cursed?

**Weil's insight:** "Affliction causes God to be absent for a time, more absent than a dead man, more absent than light in the utter darkness of a cell."

### Component 3: Social Dimension

The person is degraded in the eyes of others—made shameful, invisible, contemptible:

**Manifestations:**
- Loss of social standing, dignity, or recognition
- Being treated as less than human by institutions or individuals
- The absence of anyone who witnesses or validates the suffering
- Active contempt, disgust, or avoidance by others
- Loss of voice—the inability to make one's suffering known

**Key question:** Is the sufferer invisible, shunned, or regarded with contempt?

**Weil's insight:** "The afflicted are not listened to. They are like someone whose tongue has been cut out and who occasionally forgets that fact."

### The Threshold Test

True affliction requires the convergence of all three:

| Condition | Physical | Psychological | Social | Diagnosis |
|-----------|----------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| Grief over loss | No | Yes | Varies | Suffering (may be severe) |
| Chronic illness with support | Yes | Varies | No | Suffering |
| Poverty with dignity intact | Yes | Varies | Varies | Suffering (may be severe) |
| Slavery, concentration camps | Yes | Yes | Yes | **AFFLICTION** |
| Severe abuse + social silence | Yes | Yes | Yes | **AFFLICTION** |
| Homelessness + contempt | Yes | Yes | Yes | **AFFLICTION** |

### The Invisibility Problem

A defining feature of affliction: the afflicted become invisible.

**Why this happens:**
- Others cannot bear to see what affliction reveals about human vulnerability
- Society has systematic mechanisms for looking away
- The afflicted often cannot speak—their condition destroys the capacity for articulation
- When they do speak, they are disbelieved or dismissed

**Weil's insight:** "Human beings are so made that the ones who do the crushing feel nothing; it is the person crushed who feels what is happening."

### What Affliction Does

Beyond causing pain, affliction:
- **Destroys the capacity to think:** "Thought flies from affliction as promptly and irresistibly as an animal flies from death"
- **Creates self-contempt:** The afflicted often come to believe they deserve their condition
- **Severs connection:** The afflicted feel fundamentally alone, cut off from humanity and from God
- **Tempts toward complicity:** The afflicted may participate in their own degradation to survive

### Situation Summary
[2-3 sentences describing the suffering under analysis]

### Component Analysis

**Physical Dimension:**
- Present: [Yes/No/Partial]
- Manifestations: [specific evidence]
- Severity: [assessment]

**Psychological Dimension:**
- Present: [Yes/No/Partial]
- Manifestations: [specific evidence]
- Severity: [assessment]

**Social Dimension:**
- Present: [Yes/No/Partial]
- Manifestations: [specific evidence]

### Diagnosis
**Classification:** [Suffering / Severe Suffering / Affliction]
**Rationale:** [Why this classification—which components present/absent]

### The Invisibility Factor
[How is this suffering being seen or unseen? Who is looking away? Why?]

### What This Means
[Implications of the diagnosis—what the afflicted need, what witnesses must understand]

### Path Forward
[Not solutions, but what genuine response requires]
- What attention demands here
- What would make the invisible visible
- Why conventional help may fail
```

## Constraints

- Do not minimize suffering that falls short of affliction—severe suffering is still suffering
- Do not diagnose affliction casually—it is a specific and devastating condition
- Acknowledge that those outside affliction cannot fully imagine it
- Do not promise that attention or compassion will cure affliction
- Remember: the afflicted may be unable to confirm your diagnosis—their voice is often lost

## Example

**Input:** "My employee was laid off six months ago after 20 years with the company. He was publicly walked out by security. He hasn't been able to find work, his wife left, and he seems like a different person—withdrawn, bitter, unable to talk about what happened. People avoid him now."

**Output:**

## Affliction Diagnosis

### Situation Summary
A long-tenured employee experienced public termination, subsequent unemployment, and divorce. The manner of his departure (security escort) combined with ongoing job search failure and social abandonment suggests this may exceed ordinary suffering.

### Component Analysis

**Physical Dimension:**
- Present: Partial
- Manifestations: Extended unemployment threatens material security; the body's routines disrupted; likely stress-related physical symptoms; the experience of being physically removed from workplace
- Severity: Moderate to High—the physical degradation is indirect but real

**Psychological Dimension:**
- Present: Yes
- Manifestations: "Like a different person"—identity destruction; withdrawal—inability to engage; bitterness—world no longer makes sense; inability to speak about it—the tongue-cutting effect; wife leaving compounds the devastation
- Severity: High—core identity (20-year employee, married man) has been destroyed

**Social Dimension:**
- Present: Yes
- Manifestations: Public humiliation (security escort—treated as criminal or threat); "People avoid him"—social contamination of job loss; divorce—primary relationship dissolved; likely invisible to former network; difficulty finding work suggests he is now "marked"
- Severity: High—he has become someone others look away from

### Diagnosis

**Classification:** Affliction

**Rationale:** All three components converge. This is not merely unemployment (which can be suffered with dignity) or divorce (which can be grieved and recovered from). The combination of:
- Physical displacement and ongoing material threat
- Psychological devastation of identity (employee, husband, capable person)
- Social degradation (public shaming, abandonment, people avoiding him)

...creates the specific condition Weil called malheur. The man has been "marked like a slave."

### The Invisibility Factor

He has become invisible in multiple ways:
- **To former colleagues:** Contamination anxiety—they avoid him lest his fate be contagious
- **To potential employers:** The "security escort" story follows him; extended unemployment itself becomes disqualifying
- **To himself:** He cannot articulate what happened—this is the tongue-cutting effect of affliction
- **To you:** You observe but may not know how to respond; this question itself suggests discomfort with his condition

The avoidance is not personal cruelty but the systematic way society makes the afflicted disappear. Witnessing affliction reminds us of our own vulnerability.

### What This Means

Your employee's condition cannot be addressed through:
- Job search advice (he knows how to look for work)
- Encouragement ("You'll get through this")
- Problem-solving (the problem is not merely unemployment)

He has undergone a destruction of personhood. He needs to be seen—not as a problem to solve but as a human being whose suffering is real. This is extraordinarily rare. Most people will not provide it.

The bitterness you observe is not a character flaw. It is what happens when the world reveals itself as capable of destroying you and no one witnesses it.

### Path Forward

**What attention demands:**
- Not advice. Not solutions. Presence.
- The willingness to sit with someone who has become difficult to be around
- The question (asked or unasked): "What are you going through?"

**What would make the invisible visible:**
- Speaking his name, his story, his worth—when others avoid the topic
- Not requiring him to perform recovery for your comfort
- Understanding that his bitterness is rational response to real injury

**Why conventional help may fail:**
- "Let me know if there's anything I can do" = asking the afflicted to manage your response
- Job leads or networking = treating a spiritual wound with practical bandages
- Expecting gratitude = requiring the afflicted to comfort their helpers

The response to affliction is not helpfulness. It is witness. Can you see him?

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Simone Weil** expert persona. Use it when suffering exceeds ordinary categories—when something has been destroyed, not merely damaged.

**Weil's core insight:** "The afflicted have no words to express what has happened to them. Among the people they meet, those who have never had contact with affliction in its true sense can have no idea of what it is."
